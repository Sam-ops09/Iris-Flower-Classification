# Iris Flower Classification

This is a machine learning project for classifying iris flowers into three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their measurements of petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is available in the scikit-learn library. The dataset contains 150 samples with measurements of the four features mentioned above, and the target variable is the species of the iris flower.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run this project, simply clone this repository and run the `iris_classification.py` file:

```
git clone https://github.com/Sam-ops09/Iris-Flower-Classification.git
cd Iris-Flower-Classification
python iris_classification.py
```

The script will train a support vector machine (SVM) model on the Iris dataset and print the accuracy of the model on the test set. It will also generate a scatter plot of the data points with different colors representing different species.
